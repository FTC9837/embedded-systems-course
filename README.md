# embedded-systems-course

Program Director: Stefan Prestrelski  
Teaching Assistants: Sarah Luo, Samantha Prestrelski  

Curriculum materials can be found at http://ccagirlswhocode.weebly.com/embeddedsys.html.  



**Purpose:**  
Due to COVID-19, in-person robotics meetings and thus competitions have become less feasible given social distancing restrictions. Personal embedded systems kits can be used to remotely connect with team members and gain relevant mechanical, electrical, and programming experience.

**Materials:**  
- Computer with internet connection
- GitHub account
- Elegoo’s Super Starter Kit Uno R3 Project ([$36.99 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Project-Tutorial-Controller-Projects/dp/B01D8KOZF4/))
