This is an Arduino library that enables you to read sensor values from the
DHT11, DHT21, and DHT22 temperature and humiditiy sensors without blocking
other code execution.

The driver is based on Adafruit Industries' DHT driver library and utilizes
a state machine that is kept alive by calling it repeatedly.

To obtain the most recent version of the code or to report issues (or,
better, provide fixes), please visit the Github pages at
<https://github.com/olewolf/DHT_nonblocking>.

Inquiries via the Github issue tracker, please.  This way, others may benefit
from the answers.
